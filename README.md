### Deployment Steps

1. In your Render dashboard, click **New** and select **Web Service**.
2. Connect your Git repository.
3. Configure the following settings:
   - **Name**: Choose a name for your service (e.g., `dexxterapp`)
   - **Environment**: Node
   - **Build Command**: `npm install && chmod +x ./deploy.sh && ./deploy.sh`
   - **Start Command**: `npm start`
